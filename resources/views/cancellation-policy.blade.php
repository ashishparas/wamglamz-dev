Therefore, we respectfully request at least 24 hours notice for classifications or rescheduling of appointments. Please, understand that when you forget/cancel, or change without giving enough notice, we miss the opportunity to fill that appointment time, and clients on our wait list miss the opportunity to receive services. Therefore, we have strictly enforced 24 hours cancellation and rescheduling policy.
         </p>
         <h5>Confirmation of Appointment:</h5>
         <p>Client receive email or text message appointment reminders. These reminders are set up through the client profile in the WamGlamz booking system. These reminders are sent out 1 day before the appointment time. We confirm by email from our online appointment scheduling software because we know how easy it is to forget an appointment booked several months or week ago. </p>
         <p>From this confirmation email, you have the option of the following at no charge:</p>
         <ul class="instruct-list">

            <li>Reschedule/Change/Modify your appointment</li>
            <li>Cancel your appointment from your app/email with reason</li>
         </ul>
