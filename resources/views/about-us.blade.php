            WamGlamz was founded based on the belief that digitization can do this industry some good. Despite being one of the most fundamental and instrumental industries of modern time, it is still far from being digitally revolutionized like the rest of the businesses across different industries. Observing this space… this… this shortcoming, we realized that perhaps it was time to digitize this industry. Digitize it such that it will truly be a game-changer, for the better of course. If I could book an Uber and book an appointment with a doctor from my smartphone with a few taps, why is it not the same for my clients who want to book an appointment with me? This became our motivation and the basis for this idea.  
         <p>
            Thus began our endeavor to combine all the beauty treatments and services under one platform. A single app that offers it all with utmost convenience. Why bother to travel for ten miles to go to a salon when you have one right across the neighborhood? And that’s just the tip of the iceberg…
         </p>
         <p>WamGlamz is a compendium of convenience for both, the consumers and the service providers such that it allows for consumers to select the service provider of their choice along with their desired service to book an appointment at their desired time. For service providers, it allows for exposure and advertisement to a wide audience who can search for them based on their zip code. This ensures increased local engagement and better business prospects while providing an equal degree of convenience for the consumers. 
         </p>
         <p>The registration is absolutely free for the consumers who can then purchase the subscription of their choice to view the saloons, beauty parlors, spas, etc. in their area along with the option to book an appointment for their desired service with their desired service provider. It doesn’t get any better than this!
         </p>
         <p>Our passion is to provide high quality service to our clients on both ends of the spectrum (service providers and consumers) and act as an intermediary, linking both sides to create better prospects for everyone. This is a beauty revolution, the impact of which will resonate throughout the industry for a long, long time. Step into the future with WamGlamz and carry your beauty saloon/sap in your smartphone. Book an appointment at the touch of your finger and get glamorous!
         </p>
         <p>Being a part of this industry for so long, I understand the importance of having all of these services available on a single platform. Imagine the feasibility it will create! Events like Wedding, Engagement, Modeling, Fashion Shows, Modeling, Photoshoot, Parties, and Pageantry require a variety of services on a whim. At the same time, self-care is equally important; your right to look and feel good is as important as any other! </p>
         <p>It’s ok to pamper yourself often and enjoy a bit of “you” time. You can’t even imagine the effects a little bit of regular beauty treatment can deliver. All of this became the basis for this innovative platform that is sure as hell going to disrupt this entire industry.</p>
         <p>Take any area for example… how about Pageants? In Pageants, you need to find private makeup artists along with Mani/Pedicure experts, skincare experts, salon service providers and so much more. Obviously, it’s hard to find all these experts at the same time in one spot. But that’s where WamGlamz interjects. We are already making it happen… Become a part of the magic, download the app, and start being glamorous…
